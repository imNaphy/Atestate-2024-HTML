                            <p style="margin: 0; text-indent: 50px;">A 120 years ago the world was a very different place. The United States was emerging as a world economic power, but had yet to realize its full potential. Europe was at peace, tenuous as it was, while trouble in Russia was a portent of war and revolution to come. Much of the world remained as either economic or political colonies of the dominant powers.</p>
	                        <p style="margin: 0; text-indent: 50px;">Millions of Europe and Asia’s poor continued to travel days and weeks by steamship to seek a new life in the US. Once there, steam-driven trains were the primary means of long distance overland transport for immigrant and citizen alike. The vast rail network linked most communities and enabled those who could afford it to ride across the country in less than a week. Nevertheless, once settled, most Americans stayed at home and few ever travelled more than 25 miles from their place of birth. And so it was across the developed world.</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0; text-indent: 50px;">Transportation was taking the first tenuous steps that would soon change the world forever. With the invention of the internal combustion engine, in the late 19th century, new possibilities of motive force became available. By 1903 the automobile was set to challenge the horse. Transportation would soon change even more dramatically because of a new invention – the aeroplane. Within the century that followed, humankind took to the air led by the pioneering example of Wilbur and Orville Wright. First in frail craft, but soon in sturdy and reliable machines, aviators shattered long-standing barriers of distance and time. By mid-century air travel was common, and by the late 1905’s it had replaced the trainand steamship as the preferred method of transport. By the last quarter of 20th century, with large efficient jet-powered aircraft, air travel was commonplace and affordable to all.</p>

                        <td style="width: 20%; padding-right: 100px; text-align: justify;">
                            <p style="margin: 0; text-indent: 50px;">Flying has become second nature to hundreds of millions of people and is so deeply intertwined into the fabric of society that it is impossible to live without it.</p>
                            <p style="margin: 0; text-indent: 50px;">The aeroplane also rapidly developed as a weapon of war. Used widely during WW1, where techniques of air power were initially developed, military aircraft became an integral part of WW2. The advent of jet power, and sophisticated electronics perfected during and after the Cold War, has now turned the aircraft into a feared weapon over the 21st century battlefield.</p>
                            <p style="margin: 0; text-indent: 50px;">More than 100 years after the Wright brothers first took to the air in the first powered, controlled heavier-than-air machine, the political, social and economic challenges are different, yet, in many respects, remarkably similar. Today, aviation and spaceflight are critical tools for the improvement of the human condition and powerful instruments of positive change.</p>
